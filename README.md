# PyMp3ToSheets
Converting raw mp3 files into printable music sheets

07/25/2020 -- Still in the early phase of things. Project on pause until I finish my finals.
Progress:
1) Troubleshooting with Librosa library. Finally got the library to load() my mp3 file, but only works through anaconda (Can't get it to work on my standalone environment)
2) Researched some quick things to do with Librosa & implemented some visual aspects of the mp3 for playing around
3) Researched libraries I would want to use for the project

To do:
1) Learning how to interact with Librosa library
2) Need to learn how to use Abjad library to generate music sheets
---- If #2 is not a good alternative to LilyPond --> Go back to using Mingus/Lilypond to generate music sheets
